# Ride-Or-Die
This is my First semester game Project. I made this project in C++. This game is inspired by the famous mobile game earn to die. In this game, You have to reach the destination in the given time and also keeping yourself safe from the Airplane bombs and helicopter bullet. Also some Rockets are falling from the sky.
